Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer

Summary
What is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.
Who is at risk for lung cancer?
Lung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:
Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.
Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.
Family history of lung cancer
Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
Being exposed to radiation, such as from
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest
Radon in the home or workplace
Certain imaging tests such as CT scans
HIV infection
Air pollution
What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.
If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Chest pain or discomfort
A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)
Hoarseness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
Trouble swallowing
Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck
How is lung cancer diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
A physical exam
Imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan
Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum
A biopsy of the lung
If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.
What are the treatments for lung cancer?
For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.
The treatments for small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells
Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.
The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells
Immunotherapy
Laser therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells
Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue
Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue
Can lung cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:
Quitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work
Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.

What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

What are lung cancer genetic tests?
If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

If you have lung cancer, your health care provider may order genetic tests. These tests look for changes in the genes of the cancer cells in your body. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. There are many types of gene changes that are found in lung cancer. Knowing what type of gene change you have may help your provider to:
Predict how your lung cancer will develop over time
Match your cancer to a targeted therapy that's most likely to help you
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.
Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. It usually has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.

What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

There are different types of targeted therapies. Each type is designed to work for cancers with specific gene changes. So, lung cancer genetic tests are important to check if your cancer has a gene change that can be treated with targeted therapy.
There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most people with lung cancer have NSCLC. The most common lung cancer genetic tests are done for NSCLC. That's because this type of lung cancer is more likely to have gene changes that respond to targeted therapies.
Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene changes found in lung cancer affect genes that control how fast your cells grow and divide to make new cells. Cells with these changes grow out of control and form cancerous tumors that can spread through your body.
The gene changes in lung cancer usually aren't inherited. That means you can't pass them down to your children. You develop gene changes in certain cells in your lungs after you're born. These changes can happen if you're exposed to substances that cause cancer, such as tobacco smoke, radon gas, or air pollution. Gene changes can also happen if your cells make a mistake when they divide to make new cells.

What are they used for?
Lung cancer genetic testing is most often used to look for gene changes that are often involved in non-small cell lung cancer. The results may help guide treatment choices for targeted therapies.
There are many types of gene changes that can be involved in NSCLC. And researchers are still learning about more.
Lung cancer genetic tests may check a single gene or several genes may be checked in one test.
Why do I need a lung cancer genetic test?
You may need a lung cancer genetic testing if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The test results may help your provider know which treatments are likely to help you the most and which ones may not help at all.
What happens during a lung cancer genetic test?
The best sample for lung cancer genetic tests is tissue from a tumor in your lung. The procedure to collect a tissue sample is called a biopsy. If you had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue may be used to test for gene changes.
There are several ways to do a lung biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on many things, including where the cancer is growing in your lungs. In certain cases, tissue may be removed with a special hollow needle inserted through your skin and into your lung.
A tissue sample may also be removed during a bronchoscopy or with a procedure that involves making an incision (cut) in your chest area to insert special tube-like instruments into your lung. Talk with your provider to find out which biopsy method will work for you.
If tumor tissue can't be collected, a blood test may be used for genetic testing in certain cases. Tumor cells shed DNA into your bloodstream. Testing the tumor DNA in your blood is called a ""liquid biopsy."" This test is not as accurate as tests that use tumor tissue. Researchers are still studying the use of liquid biopsies to test for certain gene changes.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
Are there any risks to the test?
If you have a biopsy, the risks depend on the type of procedure you have. In general, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have some discomfort. Ask your provider about any risks involved with the test you're having.
What do the results mean?
If your lung cancer cells have a gene change that may respond well to a targeted therapy, your provider may start you on that treatment.
If your results show you don't have a gene change that matches a targeted therapy, your provider may discuss other treatment options. If you were tested for one gene change, other tests may be done to look for other gene changes that have targeted therapies.
Your test results may also show that your lung cancer has a gene change that:
May prevent a certain therapy from working. This information could spare you from getting treatment that won't help.
Doesn't help make treatment decisions. Researchers don't understand the importance of all the gene changes that are found in cancer.
Genetic testing may take longer than many other types of lab tests. So, you may not get your results for a few days to a week or more. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers.

When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases.

A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated).

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells.

The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.

A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope.

Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney).

Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.

A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.
Frequency
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after breast cancer, accounting for about one-quarter of all cancer diagnoses. It is estimated that more than 222,500 people develop lung cancer each year. Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung cancer during their lifetime. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur in tobacco smokers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Causes
Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. In rare cases, the genetic change is inherited and is present in all the body's cells (germline mutations).Somatic mutations in the TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are common in lung cancers. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called p53, that is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. The protein regulates cell growth and division by monitoring DNA damage. When DNA becomes damaged, p53 helps determine whether the DNA will be repaired or the cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). The EGFR and KRAS genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. When these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell proliferation.TP53 gene mutations result in the production of an altered p53 protein that cannot bind to DNA. The altered protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively and allows DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR or KRAS gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops.Mutations in many other genes have been found to recur in lung cancer cases. Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene activity (expression), cell proliferation, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and apoptosis.Researchers have identified many lifestyle and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. The greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 25-fold. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, certain metals and chemicals, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. A history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer are frequently smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Inheritance
Most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited genetic changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung.When lung cancer is related to inherited genetic changes, the cancer risk follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing the disease. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer.

Description
Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and  adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma.

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado

Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.

Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n

Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas

Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH

Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?

Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n

Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal

Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.

Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:

Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal

CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.

Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as

Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:

Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.

Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar

PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente

Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo.

Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.

Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.

Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
En ocasiones, el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n no causa ningÃºn signo o sÃ­ntoma. Se puede encontrar durante una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax realizada para otra afecciÃ³n.
Si tiene sÃ­ntomas, pueden incluir:
Dolor o molestias en el pecho
Tos que no desaparece o que empeora con el tiempo
Dificultad para respirar
Sibilancias
Sangre en el esputo (moco tosido por los pulmones)
Ronquera
PÃ©rdida de apetito
PÃ©rdida de peso sin causa aparente
Fatiga
Problemas para tragar
HinchazÃ³n en la cara y / o venas en el cuello.
Â¿CÃ³mo se diagnostica el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para hacer un diagnÃ³stico, su profesional de la salud puede utilizar:
Su historia clÃ­nica, incluyendo preguntas sobre sus sÃ­ntomas
Sus antecedentes familiares
Un examen fÃ­sico
Pruebas de imagen, como una radiografÃ­a de tÃ³rax o una tomografÃ­a computarizada de tÃ³rax
AnÃ¡lisis de laboratorio, incluyendo anÃ¡lisis de sangre y esputo
Una biopsia del pulmÃ³n
Si tiene cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, su proveedor realizarÃ¡ otras pruebas para determinar cuÃ¡nto se ha propagado a travÃ©s de los pulmones, los ganglios linfÃ¡ticos y el resto del cuerpo. Esto se llama estadificaciÃ³n. Conocer el tipo y el estadio del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tiene ayuda a su proveedor a decidir quÃ© tipo de tratamiento necesita.
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Para la mayorÃ­a de los pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n, los tratamientos actuales no curan el cÃ¡ncer.
Su tratamiento dependerÃ¡ del tipo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n que tenga, hasta quÃ© punto se ha propagado, su salud general y otros factores. Puede recibir mÃ¡s de un tipo de tratamiento.
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Quimioterapia
Radioterapia
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser, que utiliza un rayo lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
ColocaciÃ³n de stent endoscÃ³pico: Un endoscopio es un instrumento delgado en forma de tubo que se usa para observar tejidos dentro del cuerpo. Se puede usar para colocar un dispositivo llamado stent. El stent ayuda a abrir una vÃ­a aÃ©rea que ha sido bloqueada por tejido anormal
Los tratamientos para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as incluyen:
CirugÃ­a
Radioterapia
Quimioterapia
Terapia dirigida: Utiliza medicamentos u otras sustancias que atacan cÃ©lulas cancerosas especÃ­ficas con menor daÃ±o a las cÃ©lulas normales
Inmunoterapia
Terapia con lÃ¡ser
Terapia fotodinÃ¡mica: Utiliza un medicamento y un cierto tipo de luz lÃ¡ser para eliminar las cÃ©lulas cancerosas
CriocirugÃ­a: Utiliza un instrumento para congelar y destruir tejido anormal
ElectrocauterizaciÃ³n: Tratamiento que utiliza una sonda o aguja calentada por una corriente elÃ©ctrica para destruir tejido anormal
Â¿Se puede prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
Evitar los factores de riesgo puede ayudar a prevenir el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n:
Deje de fumar. Si no fuma, no empiece
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n a sustancias peligrosas en el trabajo
Disminuya su exposiciÃ³n al radÃ³n. Las pruebas de radÃ³n pueden mostrar si su hogar tiene altos niveles de este gas. Puede comprar un kit de prueba usted mismo o contratar a un profesional para que haga la prueba

IntroducciÃ³n
Â¿QuÃ© es el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n es un cÃ¡ncer que se forma en los tejidos del pulmÃ³n, generalmente en las cÃ©lulas que recubren los conductos de aire. Es la principal causa de muerte por cÃ¡ncer tanto en hombres como mujeres.
Hay dos tipos principales, cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas pequeÃ±as y cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as. Estos dos tipos crecen de manera diferente y se tratan de manera diferente. El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n de cÃ©lulas no pequeÃ±as es el tipo mÃ¡s comÃºn.
Â¿QuiÃ©n estÃ¡ en riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
El cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n puede afectar a cualquier persona, pero algunos factores  aumentan el riesgo de tenerlo:
Fumar: Es el factor de riesgo mÃ¡s importante para el cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. Fumar tabaco causa cerca de 9 de cada 10 casos de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n en hombres y 8 de cada 10 casos en mujeres. Mientras mÃ¡s temprano en la vida empiece a fumar, mÃ¡s tiempo fume y  mÃ¡s cigarrillos fume por dÃ­a, mayor serÃ¡ su riesgo de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n. El riesgo tambiÃ©n es mayor si fuma mucho y bebe alcohol todos los dÃ­as, o toma suplementos de betacaroteno. Si deja de fumar, su riesgo serÃ¡ menor del que tendrÃ­a si hubiera seguido fumando, pero aÃºn tendrÃ¡ un mayor riesgo que aquellos que nunca han fumado
Humo de segunda mano: TambiÃ©n conocido como inhalaciÃ³n pasiva de humo, consiste es la combinaciÃ³n de humo que sale de un cigarrillo y el humo que exhala un fumador. Cuando lo inhala, estÃ¡ expuesto a los mismos agentes cancerÃ­genos que los fumadores, aunque en cantidades mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as
Antecedentes familiares de cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n
Estar expuesto al asbesto, arsÃ©nico, cromo, berilio, nÃ­quel, hollÃ­n o alquitrÃ¡n en el lugar de trabajo
Estar expuesto a la radiaciÃ³n, como:
Radioterapia en el seno o el tÃ³rax
RadÃ³n en el hogar o lugar de trabajo
Ciertas pruebas de imagen como tomografÃ­as computarizadas
InfecciÃ³n por VIH
ContaminaciÃ³n del aire
Â¿CuÃ¡les son los sÃ­ntomas del cÃ¡ncer de pulmÃ³n?
